# Homework Task - What I've learned about GIT :smile:

Through this homework task I have learned the following:

- The Basics of GitHub
- The difference between Git and GitHub
- Undestanding the GitHub flow
- Important terms to know and use

**I will now explain what I'm _clued up_ on :nerd\*face: and what I'm still _confused_ about :unamused:**

## What is GitHub? :thinking:

### Git is a distributed Version Control System aka VCS

Git is a useful tool for easily tracking changes to your code and collaborating and sharing with other people. It is really easy to track changes made in a project so there is always a record of what has been worked on. Using Git makes it easy to:

- revert back to older versions of code
- work with others and collobarate on group projects

## What is the difference between Git and GitHub? :thinking:

### Github is an easy-to-use interface

It uses the same power as Git online and is home to some of the most advanced technologoes in the world. It allows you to experiment and collaborate on projects easily, without risk of losing previous work.

## What is the GitHub flow :arrow_right: Repositories, Cloning, Committing and Pushing

### Repositories

A **repository** is where project work happens - this can be worked alone or within a collobaration

### Cloning

A repository created in GitHub is stored remotely in the :cloud: which **needs to be cloned** to create a local copy on your computer, using Git to sync the two making it easier to add/or remove and fix issues. It also pulls down all repository data that GitHub has for that project.

### To Commit or Push - that is the question!

**Committing** is a way to _checkpoint_ any added changes made on your local machine to the remote repository in GitHub for yourslef or others to see.

Once you have commited all changes and are ready to add them to your repository you would then **Push** your changes.

## Important terms to know!

- `Branches` - Used to isolate work that you don't wish to merge into your project yet
- `Fork` - Used when you wish to contribute to someone else's project
- `Pull Requests` - Used when you want to gain feedback from others about changes you want to make
- `Issues` - Used to track tasks, enhancements, new plans and bugs for your work on GitHub.

### What I'm still confused about!

Whilst I feel I have a good understanding of Git and GitHub, I still feel that only more practice will get me more confident on GitHub. Knowimg when to commit and push will be quite a scary task when out in the real world.

I'm really grateful for this task to help me understand and I love that GitHub have provided some great resources to go through such as ["Git and GitHub learning resources"] (https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/git-and-github-learning-resources) I think this will be super helpful in future.
